# What is CMYK?
The CMYK color model (also known as process color, full color, or four-color printing) is a subtractive color model widely used in the printing industry. It is based on the CMY color model and utilizes four primary ink colors—cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and key (black, K)—to reproduce a wide spectrum of colors. The model works by subtracting light from a white background through the layering of inks, with each color filtering out specific wavelengths of light.
